# Development

Guide for building, testing, and contributing to
Praxis ExtProc.

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable 1.94+ (edition 2024)
- Rust nightly (for `rustfmt`; `group_imports` and
  `imports_granularity` are nightly-only)
- Docker or Podman (container builds)
- [KIND] (local Kubernetes testing)

[KIND]: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/

## Build Commands

```console
make build       # cargo build
make release     # cargo build --release
make test        # cargo test
make lint        # clippy + nightly fmt check
make fmt         # cargo +nightly fmt
make doc         # rustdoc with -D warnings
make audit       # cargo audit + cargo deny check
make container          # debug container image
make container-release  # release container image
```

Run a single test:

```console
cargo test -- test_name
```

## Local Development with KIND

Set up a full local environment with Istio and the
ExtProc server deployed:

```console
make dev-env
```

This creates a KIND cluster, installs Istio, deploys
the ExtProc server, and configures an EnvoyFilter to
wire Envoy's ext_proc filter to the server.

### Iterative Development

After the initial setup, rebuild and redeploy:

```console
make dev-push
```

This rebuilds the container image, loads it into
KIND, and restarts the deployment.

Run integration tests against the running cluster:

```console
make dev-integration
```

### Smoke Test

Run end-to-end verification:

```console
make smoke-test
```

Tear down:

```console
make kind-down
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `KIND_CLUSTER_NAME` | `praxis-extproc` |
| `EXTPROC_IMAGE` | `praxis-extproc:dev` |

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```console
make test
```

Unit tests are embedded in each source module. They
cover config parsing, adapter translation, response
building, body chunking, and TLS configuration.

### gRPC Server Tests

`tests/grpc_server.rs` starts the ExtProc server
in-process and exercises the full gRPC stream
lifecycle: request headers, request body, response
headers, response body, trailers, and rejection
scenarios.

### Service Tests

`tests/services.rs` tests the health and metrics
auxiliary services independently.

### Integration Tests

Require a running Kubernetes cluster with Istio and
the ExtProc server deployed:

```console
make test-integration
```

Gated behind the `integration` feature flag. These
tests verify end-to-end behavior through Envoy's
ext_proc filter in a real cluster.

Run with verbose output:

```console
make test-integration V=1
```

## Container Build

```console
make container          # debug binary (in-container)
make container-release  # release binary (in-container, stripped)
```

Multi-stage image: `ubi9/ubi` builder (AppStream
`rust-toolset` 1.92, `OPENSSL_NO_VENDOR=1` so the
binary links UBI9 `libssl.so.3`) and
`ubi9/ubi-minimal` plus `openssl-libs` at runtime.
Cargo is invoked with `--ignore-rust-version` because
crates declare rust-version 1.96. Builds for the host
architecture. The runtime image runs as UID 1001
(OpenShift-friendly numeric non-root user).

## CI

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/tests.yaml`)
runs on every push and pull request:

- Format check (`cargo +nightly fmt --check`)
- Clippy (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- Tests (`cargo test`)
- Doc build (`RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc`)
- Audit (`cargo audit`, `cargo deny check`)

## Project Management

This repository uses a consistent workflow for
planning, prioritizing, and tracking work.

### Milestones

Milestones represent a body of work toward a shared
goal (e.g. a release, a feature area, or a hardening
pass). Every issue and pull request should belong to
a milestone. Milestones provide scope boundaries and
help answer "what ships together?"

### Priority Labels

Priority labels indicate the order in which work
within a milestone should be addressed. Every issue
should have exactly one priority label:

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `priority/critical` | Must be worked on immediately before anything else |
| `priority/high` | Needs to be worked on immediately, defer to criticals |
| `priority/medium` | Resolve after high and critical |
| `priority/low` | Resolve after all other priority levels |

When picking up work, address issues in priority
order: critical first, then high, medium, and low.

### Project Boards

GitHub project boards visualize the state of work
across milestones. Use boards to track issues through
their lifecycle (backlog, in progress, in review,
done). Boards are the primary tool for stand-ups and
status checks.

## Coding Conventions

See [conventions.md](conventions.md) for the full
coding standards, including file ordering, test
conventions, separator comment format, and
documentation requirements.
