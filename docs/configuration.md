# Configuration

The ExtProc server is configured via a YAML file
passed with the `-c` flag. The config defines filter
chains and server settings; listeners and clusters
are omitted because Envoy owns networking.

## Top-Level Structure

```yaml
filter_chains:
  - name: security
    filters:
      - filter: guardrails
        rules:
          - target: body
            contains: "DROP TABLE"

  - name: observability
    filters:
      - filter: request_id
      - filter: access_log

server:
  grpc_address: "0.0.0.0:50051"
  health_address: "0.0.0.0:50052"
  metrics_address: "0.0.0.0:9090"
  tls:
    mode: none

insecure_options:
  allow_unbounded_body: true
```

## Filter Chains

Named filter chains defined under `filter_chains:`.
All chains are concatenated in order to form a single
pipeline. This matches the [Praxis] filter chain model
and supports the same filters.

```yaml
filter_chains:
  - name: security
    filters:
      - filter: guardrails
        rules:
          - target: header
            name: "User-Agent"
            pattern: "bad-bot.*"

  - name: transformation
    filters:
      - filter: headers
        request_add:
          - name: X-Processed-By
            value: praxis-extproc
        response_set:
          - name: X-Proxy
            value: praxis-extproc
```

The security chain runs first, then transformation.
Filters within each chain execute in order.

### Available Filters

All built-in Praxis HTTP filters are available in
ExtProc mode, plus in-tree [Praxis AI] filters from
`praxis-ai-filters`. Commonly used filters:

| Filter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `request_id` | Generate or propagate request IDs |
| `access_log` | Structured JSON access logging |
| `headers` | Add, set, or remove headers |
| `guardrails` | Reject requests matching string or regex rules |
| `ip_acl` | Allow or deny by source IP/CIDR |
| `forwarded_headers` | Inject `X-Forwarded-*` headers |
| `cors` | CORS preflight and origin validation |
| `csrf` | CSRF protection via origin validation |
| `rate_limit` | Token bucket rate limiting |
| `json_body_field` | Extract JSON body field to header |
| `path_rewrite` | Rewrite request path |
| `url_rewrite` | Regex path + query rewriting |
| `model_to_header` | Promote JSON `model` field to a request header |
| `prompt_enrich` | Prepend/append chat messages |
| `token_count` | Count tokens for a provider |
| `ai_guardrails` | AI content guardrails |
| `openai_*` / `anthropic_*` | Provider API format, validate, and stream filters |

See the [Praxis filter documentation] for core filters
and the [Praxis AI filter documentation] for AI filter
names and configuration options.

Praxis AI groups its larger subsystems behind opt-in
cargo features; this server builds in the standard
filters and everything Praxis AI offers for the OpenAI
Responses API (the response store with its Postgres and
SQLite backends, Conversations, context compaction, MCP
tools, the file resolver), as it did before those
features existed. The FIPS build, which is the image,
carries only the Responses filters; see [FIPS](fips.md).

### Branch Chains

Filter chains support conditional branching via the
`branches` field. Branch chains execute based on
filter results, enabling conditional logic within
the pipeline.

```yaml
filter_chains:
  - name: main
    filters:
      - filter: guardrails
        name: content_check
        rules:
          - target: body
            contains: "blocked-content"
        branches:
          - chain:
              filters:
                - filter: headers
                  request_add:
                    - name: X-Content-Blocked
                      value: "true"
            on_result:
              filter: content_check
              key: rejected
              value: "true"
```

See [branch-chains.yaml] for a working example.

[branch-chains.yaml]: ../examples/branch-chains.yaml

### Conditions

Filters support `when` and `unless` conditions for
request predicates (`path`, `path_prefix`, `methods`,
`headers`) and `response_conditions` for response
predicates (`status`, `headers`).

## Server

The `server` section configures bind addresses and
TLS for the three listeners.

```yaml
server:
  grpc_address: "0.0.0.0:50051"
  health_address: "0.0.0.0:50052"
  metrics_address: "0.0.0.0:9090"
  shutdown_drain_timeout_secs: 20
  max_body_bytes: 10485760
  tls:
    mode: none
```

| Field                         | Type    | Default         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------|---------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `grpc_address`                | string  | `0.0.0.0:50051` | gRPC ExtProc listen address                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `health_address`              | string  | `0.0.0.0:50052` | gRPC health check address                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `metrics_address`             | string  | `0.0.0.0:9090`  | Prometheus metrics address                                                                                                                                                                                        |
 | `shutdown_drain_timeout_secs` | integer | `20`            | Graceful-drain deadline in seconds; in-flight streams still running after it are force-cancelled. Must be **less than** the pod's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (leave headroom for a preStop lameduck and final cleanup); the `20` default fits inside the common `30`s k8s grace period |
| `max_body_bytes`              | integer | `10485760`      | Maximum accumulated request/response body size in bytes before a stream is rejected with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`. Must be greater than zero. Ignored when `insecure_options.allow_unbounded_body` is set, which lifts the cap entirely |
| `tls`                         | object  | `mode: none`    | TLS configuration                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Graceful shutdown

On `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` the health server immediately
flips the `ExternalProcessor` readiness status to
`NotServing` (staying up to report it) so Kubernetes
and Envoy stop routing before the drain, while the
gRPC server stops accepting new connections and drains
in-flight streams. If any are still running after
`shutdown_drain_timeout_secs`, they are forcefully
cancelled with `UNAVAILABLE` so the process can exit
promptly. Must be greater than zero.

#### Kubernetes deployment

Keep the drain deadline **within** the pod's grace
period, with room to spare — otherwise the process is
`SIGKILL`ed mid-drain. Budget it as:

```text
terminationGracePeriodSeconds >= preStop lameduck
                               + shutdown_drain_timeout_secs
                               + cleanup margin
```

The shipped Deployment uses the default `30`s grace
period split as preStop `5`s + drain `20`s + ~`5`s
margin. The **preStop lameduck** keeps the pod serving
while its endpoint removal propagates to Envoy /
kube-proxy, so no new streams arrive after `SIGTERM`
starts the drain. It is required, not cosmetic: the
underlying tonic server closes its gRPC listener the
moment shutdown begins (no in-process lameduck; see
grpc-rust#1940), so connections opened after `SIGTERM`
would be refused. Use the native `sleep` action — the
image ships no shell or `sleep` binary for an `exec`
hook:

```yaml
spec:
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
  containers:
    - name: payload-processing
      lifecycle:
        preStop:
          sleep:
            seconds: 5
```

### TLS

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | string | `none` | `none`, `self_signed`, or `provided` |
| `cert_path` | string | — | PEM certificate path (required for `provided`) |
| `key_path` | string | — | PEM private key path (required for `provided`) |
| `ca_cert_path` | string | — | PEM CA cert for mTLS client verification (`provided` only) |
| `handshake_concurrency` | integer | `64` | Maximum simultaneous in-flight TLS handshakes |
| `handshake_timeout_secs` | integer | `10` | Per-handshake deadline in seconds; stalled connections are dropped |

TLS modes:

- **`none`**: plaintext gRPC. Use when Envoy
  connects over localhost or a trusted network.
- **`self_signed`**: generates an ephemeral
  self-signed certificate at startup. Useful for
  development and testing.
- **`provided`**: loads certificate and key from
  disk. Use for production deployments where the
  Envoy-to-ExtProc link must be encrypted.

When `ca_cert_path` is set, the server requires
clients to present a valid certificate signed by
that CA (mTLS). Only available in `provided` mode.

Over TLS the listener serves HTTP/2. It selects
`h2` by ALPN when the client offers it, and a
client that advertises no ALPN still connects and
speaks h2 by prior knowledge. A client that
advertises ALPN without `h2` is rejected with a
fatal `no_application_protocol` alert, rather than
failing later as an opaque HTTP/2 error. Setting
`alpn_protocols: ["h2"]` on an upstream TLS client,
such as Envoy's ExtProc cluster, makes the
negotiation explicit.

`handshake_concurrency` bounds how many TLS
handshakes run in parallel; when all slots are
occupied, new TCP accepts stall until a slot frees.
`handshake_timeout_secs` cancels any single
handshake that exceeds the deadline, freeing its
slot for the next connection. Both values must be
greater than zero.

```yaml
server:
  tls:
    mode: provided
    cert_path: /etc/tls/cert.pem
    key_path: /etc/tls/key.pem
    ca_cert_path: /etc/tls/ca.pem   # optional: enables mTLS
    handshake_concurrency: 64        # optional: default shown
    handshake_timeout_secs: 10       # optional: default shown
```

## Insecure Options

Development overrides under `insecure_options:`.
These relax safety validations and emit warnings at
startup.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allow_unbounded_body` | bool | `false` | Allow unlimited body accumulation, overriding `server.max_body_bytes` |

```yaml
insecure_options:
  allow_unbounded_body: true
```

## CLI Options

The binary accepts CLI flags that override config
values:

```console
praxis-extproc [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -c, --config <PATH>            Config file path
                                 [default: praxis-extproc.yaml]
      --grpc-address <ADDR>      Override gRPC listen address
      --health-address <ADDR>    Override health check address
      --metrics-address <ADDR>   Override metrics address
  -t, --validate                 Validate config and exit
  -h, --help                     Print help
  -V, --version                  Print version
```

### Validate Configuration

Check that a config file parses correctly and all
filters resolve without starting the server:

```console
praxis-extproc -t -c praxis-extproc.yaml
```

### Logging

Logging uses `tracing` with `RUST_LOG` env-filter
syntax. Default level is `info`.

```console
RUST_LOG=debug praxis-extproc -c praxis-extproc.yaml
RUST_LOG=praxis_extproc::server=trace praxis-extproc -c praxis-extproc.yaml
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `RUST_LOG` | Tracing filter (e.g. `info`, `debug`, `praxis_extproc=trace`) |

## Example Configs

Working examples in the `examples/` directory:

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [praxis-extproc.yaml] | Common filters: request ID, access log, guardrails, headers |
| [ai-model-to-header.yaml] | AI `model_to_header` with request ID and headers |
| [llmisvc-model-provider-resolver.yaml] | `model_to_header` plus `llmisvc_model_provider_resolver` for KServe routing |
| [envoy.yaml] | Envoy config wiring up the ExtProc filter |
| [branch-chains.yaml] | Conditional branching on filter results |

[praxis-extproc.yaml]: ../examples/praxis-extproc.yaml
[ai-model-to-header.yaml]: ../examples/ai-model-to-header.yaml
[llmisvc-model-provider-resolver.yaml]: ../examples/llmisvc-model-provider-resolver.yaml
[envoy.yaml]: ../examples/envoy.yaml
[branch-chains.yaml]: ../examples/branch-chains.yaml

## Error Behavior

The server fails fast at startup for configuration
problems:

- **Invalid YAML or missing fields**: the process
  exits with a descriptive error.
- **Unknown filter name**: pipeline construction
  fails with the unrecognized filter name.
- **TLS certificate load failure**: the process exits
  if `cert_path`, `key_path`, or `ca_cert_path`
  cannot be read, or if the certificate and key do
  not match each other.
- **Invalid TLS values**: `handshake_concurrency`
  or `handshake_timeout_secs` set to zero cause an
  immediate startup error.
- **Invalid drain timeout**:
  `shutdown_drain_timeout_secs` set to zero causes an
  immediate startup error.
- **Address bind failure**: the server fails to start
  if any listen address is already in use.

At runtime:

- **Filter error**: an `Err` from a filter produces
  a gRPC `INTERNAL` status on the stream.
- **Body too large**: exceeding the
  `server.max_body_bytes` accumulation limit
  (10 MiB by default) produces a gRPC
  `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` status. The limit is lifted
  entirely when `insecure_options.allow_unbounded_body`
  is set.
- **Filter rejection**: a `FilterAction::Reject`
  returns an `ImmediateResponse` to Envoy, which
  sends the rejection directly to the client.
