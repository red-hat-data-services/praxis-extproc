# MaaS BBR Routing and Trusted-Header Boundary

## What?

Implement the routing logic that turns an authorized MaaS
model request into concrete Envoy routing decisions: route,
authority/host, path, effective model, and header mutations. Establish a trust boundary that prevents
consumer-supplied headers from influencing routing or
bypassing authorization.

### Goals

- Extract the requested model from inference request bodies
  (JSON `model` field).
- Resolve the model to an authorized provider from a trusted
  state snapshot.
- Return routing mutations that Envoy needs: route,
  authority, path, effective model, headers, and `clear_route_cache`.
- Capture or remove consumer-supplied internal MaaS headers
  and provider authentication headers before applying
  trusted replacements.
- Define deterministic failure behavior for missing models,
  unavailable providers, conflicting mutations, and deleted state.
- Preserve the authorization result across processing stages
  without allowing consumer override.

## Why?

### Motivation

MaaS allows users to request AI models through a unified
API. The platform must route each request to the correct
provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, internal KServe, etc.) based
on the requested model and the user's entitlements.

Today, `praxis-extproc` can run filter pipelines and return
header mutations, but it lacks:

1. **Trust boundary enforcement**: A consumer can send
   internal headers (`X-MaaS-Provider`, `X-MaaS-Route`) and
   potentially influence routing decisions.

2. **Model-to-provider resolution**: No mechanism to look up
   which provider serves a given model or whether the caller
   is authorized to use it.

3. **Route cache invalidation**: When routing inputs change
   (authority, path), Envoy must recalculate the route. The
   current code does not set `clear_route_cache`.

4. **Credential isolation**: Consumer credentials (OpenShift
   tokens, MaaS API keys) must not reach model backends.
   Provider credentials must come from trusted secrets, not
   consumer-supplied headers.

Without these, MaaS cannot safely route inference requests.

### User Stories

- As a **platform operator**, I want consumers to be unable
  to bypass model authorization by forging internal headers,
  so that access control is enforced.

- As a **consumer**, I want my request to route to the
  correct provider based on the model I specify, without
  needing to know provider details.

- As a **security auditor**, I want consumer credentials
  stripped before reaching backends, so that tokens cannot
  be exfiltrated by compromised models.

- As a **platform operator**, I want routing failures
  (missing model, unavailable provider) to return stable
  error responses rather than falling through to undefined
  behavior.

## How?

### Requirements

- Use the existing `model_to_header` filter from `praxis-ai-filters`
  to extract the model name from JSON request bodies.
- Store model-to-provider mappings in an in-memory routing table
  loaded from configuration.
- Perform case-insensitive model lookups to handle variations like
  "GPT-4" vs "gpt-4".
- Normalize path construction to prevent double/missing slashes when
  joining path prefixes.
- Strip headers matching configurable prefixes (e.g., `x-maas-`,
  `x-provider-`) and always strip the consumer `Authorization`
  header. Provider credentials are injected later from trusted
  secrets (Issue #6), not preserved from the caller.
- Set `clear_route_cache: true` when authority or path mutations
  would change Envoy's route selection.
- Return deterministic errors for missing models and unknown providers.
- Do not re-check caller entitlements inside BBR. Authorization is
  enforced by the external auth layer before ExtProc (Issue #4).
  BBR preserves that result by resolving providers only from trusted
  state and stripping consumer routing/provider headers.

### Design

#### Authorization during BBR

BBR does not perform caller authorization checks:

- `BbrProcessor.process_request()` does **not** receive an
  authorization context.
- `RoutingState` does **not** filter by caller entitlements; it is
  a trusted model→provider lookup only.
- Preservation across stages: strip consumer-supplied routing /
  provider / auth headers (`TrustBoundary`), then apply mutations
  from `RoutingState` only — so an authenticated caller cannot
  select a provider via headers.

#### Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| `BbrProcessor` | Orchestrates model resolution, trust boundary, and mutation generation |
| `RoutingState` | In-memory model-to-provider lookup table |
| `ProviderConfig` | Provider details: authority, path_prefix, cluster, effective_model |
| `TrustBoundary` | Identifies headers to strip based on configurable prefixes |
| `BbrResult` | Output: `headers_to_set`, `headers_to_remove`, `clear_route_cache`. Route/cluster is **not** a separate ExtProc field — it is conveyed via header mutations Envoy's route config matches on (e.g. `:authority`, `:path`, and a routing header carrying the cluster/route name from `ProviderConfig`), then `clear_route_cache` forces Envoy to re-select the route. |

#### Error Handling

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Model not in X-AI-Model header | Skip BBR processing (filter not configured) |
| Empty model string in header | Return `RoutingError::ModelMissing` |
| Model not found in routing table | Return `RoutingError::ModelMissing` |
| Provider resolution fails | Return `RoutingError::ProviderNotFound` |
| Conflicting mutations (filter vs BBR) | BBR mutations take precedence; BBR runs after filters |
| Stale / deleted routing state | Lookup returns a per-request snapshot of `ProviderConfig`. Concurrent deletion after lookup does not change the in-flight request. Later requests that no longer find the model return `RoutingError::ModelMissing`. Never fall through to consumer-controlled routing. Live reload / K8s delete delivery is Issue #7. |

#### Effective Model

The issue requires returning an "effective model" in mutations. This handles
cases where the provider uses a different model name internally:

- User requests `gpt-4` → provider expects `gpt-4-turbo-preview`
- The `effective_model` field in `ProviderConfig` specifies the mapping
- If set, BBR adds an `X-Effective-Model` header with the mapped name
- The original model name in the request body is NOT modified (body mutation
  is out of scope; only header mutations are returned)
